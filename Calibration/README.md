## Camera Calibration
Camera calibration is the process of estimating parameters of the camera using images of a special calibration pattern. The parameters include camera intrinsics, distortion coefficients, and camera extrinsics.

- Distortion can change the apparent size of an object in an image.
- Distortion can change the apparent shape of an object in an image.
- Distortion can cause an object's appearance to change depending on where it is in the field view.
- Distortion can make objects appear closer or farther away than they actually are.

### Types of distortion:
#### Radial distortion:
Real cameras use curved lenses to form an image, and light rays often bend a little too much or too little at the edges of these lenses. This creates an effect that distorts the edges of images, so that lines or objects appear more or less curved than they actually are. This is the most common type of distortion.

#### Tangential distortion:
This occurs when a cameraâ€™s lens is not aligned perfectly parallel to the imaging plane, where the camera film or sensor is. This makes an image look tilted so that some objects appear farther away or closer than they actually are.
